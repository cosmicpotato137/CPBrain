## INGREDIENTS
- [ ] 2 (15-ounce/425g) cans black beans, undrained*
### Sofrito
- [ ] 1 ½ tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- [ ] 1 small red or yellow onion, diced
- [ ] 4 garlic cloves, chopped
- [ ] 1 jalapeño or serrano pepper, diced**
- [ ] ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- [ ] 1 ½ teaspoons dried Mexican oregano
- [ ] ½ teaspoon chipotle chile flakes or red pepper flakes***
- [ ] 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt
- [ ] Freshly cracked black pepper
- [ ] 1 pound (454g) fresh tomatoes or 1 (14-ounce/400g) can of diced tomatoes
### Finishing
- [ ] A glug of extra virgin olive oil****
- [ ] A squeeze or two of lime juice
- [ ] 1 cup (16g) fresh cilantro leaves and stems, chopped

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Don’t drain the beans
2. Prep the fresh tomatoes, if using. Wash, and then add to a food processor and pulse until pureed. Or grate the tomatoes using the wide holes of a box grater.
3. Make the sofrito. Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat with 1 ½ tablespoons of oil. Once hot, add the onion with a pinch of salt and cook until the onion has softened and is golden but not browned, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic, jalapeño, cumin, oregano, and chipotle flakes (if using) and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
4. Add the diced tomatoes. Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a rapid simmer and cook until the tomatoes break down and most of the liquid has evaporated, 8 to 10 minutes. Season with the kosher salt and several cracks of black pepper.
5. Pour the black beans with their liquid into the sofrito. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 15 minutes until thickened and saucy. If it gets too thick, add a splash of vegetable broth if you have it, or water.
6. Stir in a glug of extra virgin olive oil, a squeeze of lime juice, and cilantro. Taste, and add salt/pepper or more lime juice to taste.

## NOTES

*How to make with dried black beans: Soak ½ pound (227g) black beans overnight (add 1 teaspoon baking soda to the soaking water to help soften); drain. Cook the beans in 3 cups (720 mL) water + add 2 bay leaves and a few fresh oregano sprigs if you have them. Cook the beans for at least an hour, probably longer, until they’re tender. Then scoop out 1.5 cups (360 mL) cooking liquid and discard for maximal sauciness. Make the sofrito and add it to the pot of cooked beans with 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and rapidly simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until thickened and saucy. Follow step 4 as written.
