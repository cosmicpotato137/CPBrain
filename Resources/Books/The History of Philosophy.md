By Bertrand Russell

## Notes
### Preface 
philosophy has people grapple with the unknown without resorting to religion. Grappling with the infinitude of knowledge through reason. 

### The Rise of Greek Civilization 
5: the pantheons of Egypt and Babylon came from warring cities with their own gods or pantheons, ending with the god of victorious city being supreme. 

11: The odyssey is a bit anti-theistic. Gods are portrayed as people and subjected to [[fate]], necessity, or [[destiny]]. Kind of an early for religion

13: many philosophers of Hellenic grece were refugees, including [[xenophanes]]!

14/15: Cult of Bacchus/Dionysus had brutal practices, but also aspects of feminism. Respectable maifs and matrons would spend nights dancing naked in the hills, which stimulated *extacy*. Alcoholic or mystical intoxication. 

15: agriculture required reason. Doing unprofitable labor now to receive a reward in the future. 

Prudence can obviously be taken too far. Worshipers of Bacchus react against forethought. The best human achievement comes from some intoxication. 

19: Orphic religion is a reformation of worshipers of Bacchus, maintaining many of the same elements of spiritual extacy. 

Ultimately it is this excess passion combined with excess rationality that made Greek thought so influential.
