Hi Aline,  

I hope you are doing well! I have decided to apply to grad school to get my masters in robotics. I'm applying to a few different places, including UPenn Villanova, and École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne through Fulbright. Would you feel comfortable writing a strong letter of recommendation for me to these programs? Letters to grad school are not necessarily the same as letters to Fulbright because Fulbright is looking for how I fit with their goals of cultural exchange and community engagement. Please let me know if there is any other information I can provide. 

The letter for Fulbright is due sometime in September, and grad school letters aren't due until December when I submit my application. If you will have trouble meeting these deadlines, please let me know at your earliest convenience.

All the best,
Mac

Here is a link to the guidelines for writing Fulbright recommendations, but let me know if there is anythi

The letter for Fulbright is due *Tuesday October 10, 2023 at 5 pm*, and grad school letters are due early December. If you will have trouble meeting these deadlines, please let me know at your earliest convenience.
