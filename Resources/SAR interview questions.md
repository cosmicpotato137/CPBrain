# SAR interview questions

## **Task management**

******S:****** Finals week is always incredibly busy, and everything needs to get done. 

******A:****** The two main categories I prioritize by are due date and importance. In any semester, there are always classes that are more or less important to me, and the finals for those classes are weighted differently. While this isn’t a one size fits all solution, I tend to prioritize by the work that is most important to me that has to get done the soonest. I also use Notion to help me organize myself around these priorities. 

******R:****** The this method allows me to get the most out of my most important work and minimize procrastination around the least important. 

## Stress management

****S:**** Academic stress is something that I have always struggle to manage. When I feel overwhelmed, it is easy for me to hole up in my room until I finish everything. 

******A:****** For me, the best way to manage stress is to keep an active and healthy lifestyle outside of work. Exercising daily, eating well, and getting enough sleep throughout the semester are all essential for me to perform well when the work becomes overwhelming. 

******R:****** Realizing that my mental and physical health are more important than 99% of all the work I do in college has improved the quality of my work and allowed me to start working smarter, not harder.

## Conflict

******S:****** 

****A:****

****R:****

## Adaptability

******S:******  Working as a TA for a disorganized class forced me to always adapt to the student’s needs and communicate well with the professor.

****A:**** I ended up teaching the students core concepts during my TA hours in addition to helping them with their labs.

****R:**** The students had a better understanding of the material of the course.

## Failure

******S:****** Algebra II. COVID-19. For the first two years of college I thought I wanted to be a math major, I enjoyed the subject in high school, and the math department at Haverford College is excellent both in its community and rigor. However, I was never able to perform as well as I wanted in college math classes. Algebra II was the culmination of a notoriously difficult professor and my first taste of remote learning during the second half of my fourth semester. 

****A:**** Since it went remote, I was unable to collaborate with peers and the professor. I was essentially on my own, learning a subject that had become unfulfilling to me. 

****R:**** There are two lessons that I took away from my time in the math department. The first is to always know the ‘why’ behind any decision I make. It is not good enough to do something because you have done it in the past. The second is to give myself the space to be confused, and be excited rather than scared to collaborate with peers or people who are more competent than you. 

# Leadership

**************S:************** The las time I assumed a leadership role was during my internship with Professor Kumar. I was only working with one other person and reporting to the professor, but I found myself doing much of the project management.

****A:**** I ********created a timeline for the project, keeping in mind major deadlines and goals, and adapted it as we encountered  difficult concepts, or bugs.

****R:**** We ended the summer having completed our goals

******S:****** Teaching classes for climbing gym

****A:**** 

## Goal setting

Any goal that I actually achieve, unless I am particularly motivated, is specific, divisible and deadline driven. I want to run a marathon. Based on the fitness level I am at, I will start by running 10 miles/week and increase the mileage by 2 each week until I reach 25 miles/week. 

## Professional/academic accomplishment

****S:**** Completing my thesis!!

****A:**** This required me to plan ahead for the year that I was working on the project. I created a rough schedule for myself to meet my thesis requirements while following the guidance of my advisor. 

****R:**** I built a unity package for procedural modeling using shape grammars

## Communication

******S:****** internship with remote team

******A:****** how did we share information, listen to each other, move forward productively

accused of cheating in high school

formative experience that has affected how I handle confrontation 

## Other things I want might want to mention

## Uniqueness

My diverse background and broad set of interests make me uniquely suited for this role. With an undergraduate education encompassing higher level mathematics, visual studies, and philosophy, I have cultivated a comprehensive understanding of the world. I strongly believe that this breadth of knowledge and interdisciplinary perspective are vital in navigating the dynamic and evolving technological and social landscape. Notably, my ability to simultaneously engage in a compiler design class and a performance art course, exploring the intersections of time commodification and technological development, demonstrates my capacity to embrace and connect diverse ideas. This adaptability and interdisciplinary approach position me to bring fresh insights and innovative solutions to the challenges of this role.
