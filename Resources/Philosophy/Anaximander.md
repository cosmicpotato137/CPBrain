**Cosmic order**
Anaximander assumed, like traditional religion, the existence of a cosmic order; and his ideas on this used the old language of myths which ascribed divine control to various spheres of reality.

**Infinity**
Anaximander may have been the earliest use of the word apeiron (ἄπειρον "infinite" or "limitless") to designate the original principle. He was the first philosopher to employ, in a philosophical context, the term archē (ἀρχή), which until then had meant beginning or origin.

**Opposites**
The Universe originates in the separation of opposites in the *primordial matter*. It embraces the opposites of hot and cold, wet and dry, and directs the movement of things. 

**Disproof of water**
All cannot be water because if it were, water would take over all other elements. This there must be a cosmic justice, or order.
