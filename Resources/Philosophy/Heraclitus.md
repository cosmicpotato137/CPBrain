Believed Logos was the organizing principle of the universe

1. Panta rhei: Heraclitus believed that everything in the universe is in a state of constant flux and change. He famously stated that "panta rhei," which means "everything flows" in Greek.
2. Logos: According to Heraclitus, the fundamental principle that governs the universe is "logos." This term can be translated as "word," "reason," or "principle," and it refers to the underlying order and unity of the universe.
3. Opposites: Heraclitus believed that everything in the universe is composed of opposites, such as hot and cold, light and dark, and life and death. He argued that these opposites are necessary for the universe to function properly.
4. Unity of opposites: Heraclitus also believed that these opposites are not in conflict with one another, but rather are united in a greater whole. He argued that everything in the universe is interconnected and that all things are part of a single, unified system.
5. Importance of change: Heraclitus emphasized the importance of change and adaptation. He argued that those who are unable to adapt to changing circumstances will not survive, while those who are able to adapt will thrive.
