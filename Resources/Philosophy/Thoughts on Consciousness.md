We do philosophy by thinking. All thought leads to other thoughts, and  we build systems for thinking, structured by language. Such systems of include logic, and mathematics, religion and philosophy. 

Does thought fail to be self referential?

Consciousness must exist beyond thought because I can stop thinking. 

The 'I' in 'I think therefore I am', is simply a construction of thought, albeit a correct one. It is a construction of an ego that must prove itself existant, whereas pure consciousness knows existamcelike the land knows the sea.

- must we then rejoice in thought because we that think make such a small part of the universe?
- I am lmao precede being, but is not itself being, and cannot describe its feeling.
