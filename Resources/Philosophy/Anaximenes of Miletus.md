**Air is all**
Anaximenes thought that air—or, literally, aer, which may also include mist or vapor—was the primary substance that held the universe together.

He also believed that all celestial bodies, including earth float on air

**Quantitative density**
Anaximenes was the first philosopher to associate the qualitative change in hot/dry and cold/wet pairings with the quantitative density of a single material.
