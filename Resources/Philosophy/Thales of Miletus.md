**All is water**

**Unity of substance**
Most agree that Thales's stamp on thought is the unity of substance. Not merely the empirical claim that all is water, but the deeper philosophical claim that all is one. 

**Floating earth**
Thales, imagined the Earth floating in water, the "immense ocean from which everything is born and upon which the Earth floats."
