# God is dead
- Separation of mind from body - [[Plato]]
- Mind is accesible only in death - Christianity
- Mind is inaccessible - [[Kahnt]]
- The attention lulls and people go on living their lives
- God is now dead, and although it may take the masses time to realize, there is no reason left to believe in god. "Plato blushes in embarrassment"
- people no longer have a rigid system of belief. The sun that held morality in orbit has vanished
- the new philosopher now rejoices in the freedom of tetherless philosophy. 

# The Wanderer
Hiking the mountain to escape societythe wanderer seeks philosophical adventure, not attaching themself to any ideology. 

Nietzsche believes that philosophy is best done by the wanderer. No philosopher has ever been proven correct, and as such, no system for thought should we taken too seriously. 

# Pre Platonic Philosophy
- Pre platonic not Pre Socratic 
- Pre platonics all had to define what it means to do philosophy separately 
- All pre platonics are hewn from a single stone. Each had to form an idea of philosophy for themselves. Themes and ideas from each appear in Plato's worksthey also give us a store of materialism in grece. 

Fun quote 22min

All pre platonic philosophers overcame the following: 
- The mythical - by concept
- The proverbial sporadic - by systematizing 
- Science - by applying their theory to the world
