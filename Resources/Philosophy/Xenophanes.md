**life**
- He was a refugee!
- "This is the sort of thing we
should say by the fireside in the winter-time, as we lie on soft couches,
after a good meal, drinking sweet wine and crunching chickpeas: 'Of
what country are you, and how old are you, good Sir? And how old
were you when the Mede appeared?' "

**Reformer**
Xenophanes sought to reform the understanding of divine nature by casting doubt on Greek mythology as relayed by Hesiod and Homer, in order to make it more consistent with notions of piety from Ancient Greek religion.
