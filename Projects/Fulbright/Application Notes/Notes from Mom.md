Theme: Life through the lens of community and how this has supported me positively:

**Throughout my academic career, I thought I had to figure it out myself, if I couldn’t I was hard on myself but there’s no path without a diverse community around me.**

In high school, math came easily to me. I was able to complete 

Up until college, my community was always something that I took for granted. I had many communities growing up:

- Soccer teams, karate, away camp, first lego league
- Team Altitude in middle school

After middle school, I no longer had a strong community to rely on for academic support. There were teachers and classmates, but everyone was generally on their own path of learning, and besides the occasional group project, I did not learn from my peers in the same way. 

Fast forward to college, and I rediscovered a community to some extent. The college as a whole, and the math department-which I quickly became a part of-provided lots of opportunities to build connections and foster learning in and out of the classroom. Despite the richness that the institution provided, I unable to harness that community. High school had taught me that I was able I did not need a community to succeed in academics, so long as I worked hard enough. I was falsely confident in my abilities which quickly led to imposter syndrome after my first semester. I was getting the worst grades of my life and did not know how to use the tools that were right in front of me. 

Two big realizations were required for me to eventually overcome my feelings of imposter syndrome. First was a change in mind set. I was feeling like I didn’t belong because the subject material was not coming as easily to me as I had hoped. 

- I was so eager to understand the subject matter that I had forgotten to enjoy the process of learning.

In other words, I was so used to being competent, that I had unknowingly started to resent incompetence, when in reality, it is far more engaging to be a beginner. 

Because I hated being a beginner, I was nervous to betray my situation to my peers, and thus would often study alone. 

I am saying this because I eventually figured it out. It took a change of major to computer science to realize that I was in part, running from the feeling of being a beginner. Since then I have let myself be bad at more than just school, and have as a result, improved at everything I am most passionate about. Not only have I improved, but I have also been able to build friendships and communities with people who share my interests, learning from and teaching each other. 

This is the community that I want to find as I pursue my academic goals of robotics and physical goals of climbing, and running.

Influences: Tracing the path of computer science from FirstLL to now

- First LL: Beginning of season, middle and the end - working with group, dynamics, topic - first experience with big group project
    - Specific story of impact - mentor connection, in the middle of an exercise or competition when something happened, or you witnessed a quality that you’d like to emulate
- Altitude: Idea of community, self-directed learning
    - Specific story of impact: choosing a topic of study as a group? Coming to a consensus about what we wanted to learn
- Engineer program at Dartmouth:
    - Specific story of impact:
- Geometry: how this fired you up about math
    - Specific story of impact: first proof
    - The first instance I can remember of really being fired up about math, was my first lesson in non-euclidean geometry. My teacher at the time, Mrs. Whit, made an anecdotal argument for Euclid’s 5th postulate (without calling it by that name) by asking us why, when we look down a pair of train tracks, they appear to meet at the horizon. It could be a trick of perspective, but if we suppose the lines actually do meet, we have a spherical geometry.
