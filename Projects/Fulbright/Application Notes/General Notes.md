I would bring a highly technical and creative passion to Fulbright. I believe that my cross-disciplinary education has prepared me for the challenges of cultural exchange, while my research and project work has prepared me for the robotics program at EPFL.

- FLL
- Math at dartmouth
- Honesty about my path through the math department, ending ac CS
- Want to return to a more hands on discipline.

The Fulbright scholarship will allow me to build that community while furthering my own goals to 

Part of my disillusionment with the math department was my own fault. I was not able to find support when I needed it most.

Path: FLL, Scratch → coding in middle school → accelerated math → math at haverford → computer science at haverford → robotics again!

I want to use my software skills to build smarter machines through machine and learning, computer vision and computer vision to solve problems of sustainability and social change.
