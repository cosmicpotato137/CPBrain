## Notes

[[Notes from Mom]]
- national geographic
- FLL
- Math at dartmouth
- Honesty about my path through the math department, ending ac CS
- Want to return to a more hands on discipline.

The Fulbright scholarship will allow me to build that community while furthering my own goals to 

Part of my disillusionment with the math department was my own fault. I was not able to find support when I needed it most. 

| FLL/Scratch | Middle School | High School Math | Haverford Math | Computer Science |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Collaborative | Collaborative | I was the only one taking the classes I was in | I felt alone even though I wasn’t  | Still alone, but not really? |  |
|  |  |  | Talk about the greek genius? |  |  |

Path: FLL, Scratch → coding in middle school → accelerated math → math at haverford → computer science at haverford → robotics again!
