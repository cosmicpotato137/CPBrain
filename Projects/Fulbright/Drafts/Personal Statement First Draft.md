# Personal Statement First Draft

I have not always liked robots. When I was three, was terrified of the toy car with the yellow button that made a noise when you pressed it. I couldn’t understand how something so dead could be so loud. Eventually I learned how electrical circuits can transfer energy into a vibrating meatal speaker by directing an electric field. Despite my initial reaction, I quickly grew to love circuits, and in elementary school my mom, and a few other motivated parents, organized a team to compete in FIRST Lego League (FLL). 

When thinking about why I suddenly  find robotics interesting, I come to a few conclusions. When I was in elementary school I took part in FLL, a lego robotics competition where teams would be ranked based on technical robotics skill and presentation on a solution to a real world problem. The Robotics may have been built out of legos but the real-world solutions were often well researched. I remember one of the themes was diseases. We focused on Alzheimer's disease and presented a solution that uses nano-robots to neutralize the built-up plaque around nerve endings. This sense of purpose was incredibly inspiring for me because I have always been interested in helping people. FLL was one of my first introductions to programing and I spent the next 10 years developing various computational skills. I completed the math curriculum at my high school in record time and took the AP computer science as an independent study. since it wasn’t offered in the small school I attended. However, I never made another opportunity for myself to pursue robotics. Maybe I was having an existential crisis that drew me towards domains which are perfectly controllable, or maybe my interests just changed. Whatever the case, I continued pursuing math in college, and got most of the way through my degree before realizing that it wasn’t what I wanted to be doing, and probably hadn’t been for a while. Thus, I landed at computer science, something that I had continued to study mostly in my free time until my sophomore year. I completed my degree in computer science, specializing in computer graphics. Starting early in my computer science career, I was aware of the moral dilemmas presented by computer science. Computers run the modern world, and so anyone who can program them can exhibit their will on the world in a large way. Upon receiving my degree, I spent a long time thinking about what I want to use it for. For me, meaning often comes in service to others. Thus, I want to work on the problems which have the largest potential to affect people’s lives for the better. Climate change is one of those problems

# Personal Statement

## Question Details

The statement should be a 1 page narrative that provides a picture of yourself as an individual․ It should deal with your personal history, family background, influences on your intellectual development, the educational, professional, and cultural opportunities (or lack of them) to which you have been exposed, and the ways in which these experiences have affected you․ Also include your special interests and abilities, career plans, and life goals, etc․ It should not be a recording of facts already listed on the application or an elaboration of your Statement of Grant Purpose․ It is more of a biography, but specifically related to you and your aspirations relative to the specific Fulbright Program to which you have applied․

## Notes

[[Notes from Mom]]
- national geographic
- FLL
- Math at dartmouth
- Honesty about my path through the math department, ending ac CS
- Want to return to a more hands on discipline.

Throughout my academic career I thought that I had to figure everything out for myself, and when I couldn’t, I was incredibly hard on myself. While my goal is to do research that I am passionate about, there is no path forward without a diverse community around me.

The Fulbright scholarship will allow me to build that community while furthering my own goals to 

Part of my disillusionment with the math department was my own fault. I was not able to find support when I needed it most.

| Collaborative | Collaborative | I was the only one taking the classes I was in | I felt alone even though I wasn’t  | Still alone, but not really? |  |

Path: FLL, Scratch → coding in middle school → accelerated math → math at haverford → computer science at haverford → robotics again!

****Nicholas Bayan -**** I never got to do study abroad,’’ says Mostaghim, who is the son of Iranian immigrants. “I wanted to go somewhere that I’d be able to work with a lot of people from different backgrounds and live in a different culture while conducting research that I’m very, very interested in.
