Climate change confronts humanity with escalating temperatures, sea level rise, and dwindling biodiversity. Existing solutions, such as renewable energy sources and environmental cleanup initiatives, hold promise but require scalable implementation. Robotics plays a vital role in addressing this issue, with the potential of providing an autonomous workforce to efficiently implement climate change solutions at scale. Having completed my bachelors of computer science, I want to build my skills towards a master's of Robotics at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland with the goal of scaling new and existing solutions for climate change. The EPFL robotics program provides opportunities to take classes on sustainability and partner with Swiss companies while completing the degree. As a country Switzerland aims to have net zero emissions by 2050, laying the groundwork for the economic growth of green energy and carbon capture solutions. Completing my master's with Fulbright will give me the requisite knowledge and network to work towards the goal of zero emissions in the US.
