Statement of Purpose

Dear Fulbright Selection Committee,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Fulbright student program and my desire to pursue the proposed program in Switzerland. As an aspiring robotics student and ****************************something else****************************, I am particularly drawn to the country's strong climate policies, the abundance of opportunities it offers, and its exceptional quality of life.

Switzerland stands out for it’s progressive climate policies, ranking ninth in Yale's Environmental Performance Index of 2022. This commitment to environmental sustainability resonates with my own passion for combating climate change through innovative technologies. **********************************************************************According to the article I read …********************************************************************** Switzerland provides a thriving ecosystem for my academic and professional growth in robotics. Research centers and collaborations such as [CLIMACT](https://www.climact.ch/projects) and the [Swiss National Center for Competence in Robotics](https://nccr-robotics.ch/) (NCCR) provide opportunities for professional research. Additionally, Switzerland is home to many Robotics companies such as Sevensense Robotics and F&P Robotics, some of which have spawned from research funded by EPFL. A couple of projects and companies which have most peaked my interest are ARC (Autonomous River Cleanup) and the CLIMACT project “Robotic platform for monitoring the biodiversity of retreating glaciers.”

The choice to apply to the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) stems from careful consideration. EPFL boasts one of the world's top robotics programs and offers numerous research opportunities. EPFL provides a customizable program that allows me to specialize either in research or practical application. Furthermore, EPFL offers the option to pursue a cross-disciplinary master's degree in a minor subject area such as Engineering for Sustainability, which aligns perfectly with my aspiration to leverage robotics to address environmental challenges. I am eager to explore the intersections of robotics, sustainability, and social impact through this program.

My passion for robotics stems from a desire to extend my software  development skills to solve hardware challenges. While I have been programming software for a significant period, I now seek to enhance the efficacy of my code by building smarter machines. Through machine learning, computer vision, and robotics, I aim to tackle pressing issues of sustainability and drive positive social change. Pursuing a graduate degree in robotics will equip me with the necessary knowledge and practical skills to accomplish these goals.

I have a solid academic foundation that meets the prerequisites for the proposed graduate degree program. My Bachelor's degree in Computer Science has provided me with a strong technical background, complemented by coursework in Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. This multidisciplinary preparation will enable me to excel in the rigorous academic environment of EPFL's robotics program.

Beyond academic pursuits, I am eager to immerse myself in the Swiss culture and contribute to the host community. As an avid climber and chocolate lover, ****… .**** Additionally, I am committed to engaging with the local community through volunteer activities. I have actively participated in climbing initiatives and environmental projects, dedicating my time and skills to furthering sustainability and supporting research endeavors.

Regarding language proficiency, the robotics program at EPFL is primarily taught in English. 

In conclusion, the Fulbright student program offers a remarkable opportunity for me to pursue my passion for robotics and contribute to the global efforts in combating climate change. Switzerland, with its exemplary climate policies, diverse opportunities, and outstanding quality of life, is the ideal destination for me to thrive academically, professionally, and personally. I am confident that my background, commitment to the host community, and dedication to leveraging robotics for sustainable solutions make me a strong candidate for the Fulbright program.

Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly anticipate the chance to make a positive impact in Switzerland while broadening my horizons and developing lasting cross-cultural connections.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
