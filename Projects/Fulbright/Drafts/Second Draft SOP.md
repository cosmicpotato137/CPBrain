# Intro

Many solutions to climate problems rely on our ability to scale them up, and others are simply inaccessible, or dangerous for humans. Robotics can offer a vast array of tools to tackle this problem, but is underused. According to Sherry Chen in "How Roboticists Can Tackle Climate Change,” climate robotics accounts for less than 1 percent of total robotics venture funding over the past five years. For example, AES has created a robot which can install solar panels faster and more densely than humans, making for more efficient solar farms. 

- In research, this looks like SS MAPR, an autonomous robot developed by Sherry Chen for collecting multi-depth water quality data.

According to Sherry Chen in "How Roboticists Can Tackle Climate Change,” climate robotics accounts for less than 1 percent of total robotics venture funding over the past five years. I can only imagine what solutions can be found if more interest and funding is given to climate robotics.

Climate change is one of the largest problems that humanity is grappling with today. The way we treat our planet is reflected back to us in rising temperatures and sea levels and decreasing biodiversiy of critical ecosystems. Furthermore, climate change disproportionately affects the health and wellbeing of the most economically vulnerable and underprivilaged communities. These challenges must be faced from every possible angle if we are to bring balance to our planet. Many solutions already exist such as solar and wind farms, carbon sequestering, sustainable farming, and reforestation efforts. However, many of these solutions would benefit from 

What do you want to do and why is it important?

- Climate change is important, and must be attacked from many angles.
- There are some efforts such as robotic river cleaning, example 2, example 3, according to "How Roboticists Can Tackle Climate Change” by Sherry Chen, robotics can aid existing climate change efforts by scaling them up.
    - In industry this looks like a solar panel installation robot by AES which can install solar panels faster and more densely than humans, making for more efficient solar farms.
    - In research, this looks like SS MAPR, an autonomous robot developed by Sherry Chen for collecting multi-depth water quality data.
    - Robots are great at doing repetitive tasks that require precision and stamina
- The future of our harmful effect on the climate and the environment relies on our ability to scale up the solutions we already have.

There are two ways to view the importance of climate action. The first, subscribes to the philosophy that nature is inherently good and deserves to be preserved. It is the moral argument of “how would we like it if some other species came in and drove humanity to extinction.” We should treat nature like we want to be treated. The second is the idea of necessity. The climate crisis poses an existential threat in its own right. We as a species must find a balance with the planet we inhabit, lest we make it increasingly difficult for ourselves to exist on earth. I can cite both of these as reasons for my interest in the climate crisis. I believe that there is both a moral and existential imperative that should drive all work on preserving the ecosystems and climate of our planet. 

# EPFL

The choice to apply to the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) stems from careful consideration. EPFL boasts one of the world's top robotics programs and offers numerous research opportunities. EPFL provides a customizable program will give me exposure to both research and application of robotics. I will learn how to implement autonomous, intelligent robots in courses like Legged robots and Deep learning for autonomous vehicles, while implementing them in a variety of academic and extracurricular projects. Furthermore, EPFL offers the option to pursue a cross-disciplinary master's degree in  Engineering for Sustainability, which aligns perfectly with my aspiration to leverage robotics to address environmental challenges. Courses like Development Engineering, and Behind/Beyond Future Cities will help me better understand how my robotics experience can benefit climate change. I am eager to explore the intersections of robotics, sustainability, and social impact through this program.

My learning at EPFL will culminate in a master’s thesis where I will work on autonomous control systems for mobile robots.

# Switzerland

Switzerland provides a thriving ecosystem for my academic and professional growth in robotics. Research centers and collaborations such as [CLIMACT](https://www.climact.ch/projects) and the [Swiss National Center for Competence in Robotics](https://nccr-robotics.ch/) (NCCR) provide opportunities for professional research and my internship at EPFL. Additionally, Switzerland is home to many Robotics companies such as Sevensense Robotics and F&P Robotics, some of which have spawned from research funded by EPFL. A couple of projects and companies which have most peaked my interest are ARC (Autonomous River Cleanup) and the CLIMACT project “Robotic platform for monitoring the biodiversity of retreating glaciers.” ********************During my stay in Switzerland I will reach out to these projects either independently, or as part of my internship. 

# My Background in research and computer science

My preparation for robotics has been mostly theoretical and computationally oriented. I completed high school with the intention of becoming a math PhD., quickly finishing the standard math program and taking curses at the college level. Although I taught myself to program, it wasn’t on my radar as something I really wanted to pursue academically until the end of my sophomore year of college. During my sophomore and junior summers, I interned for the Haverford Computer Science department, studying mouse input biometrics for user authentication under Professor Rajesh Kumar. This was my first experience with practical machine learning, using python, Tensorflow, and Keras to build and test our models. My Thesis research was my first experience designing and implementing a tool on my own. I took on part of a larger project called Spatialized Performance And Ceremonial Event Simulations (SPACES). The aim of SPACES is to create parametrized crowd simulations to understand ancient ceremonial events. My contribution consists of a tool for procedurally generating buildings and cities for those events. The method I implemented is called a Shape Grammar, and works by encoding complex, repeating patterns and shapes through the spatial relationships of their components. My thesis culminated in an interpreter to handle these types of encodings which I designed for Unity game engine.

I gained many technical skills through the projects I completed in undergrad, but they also gave me an understanding of the work I want to do moving forward. When I think about the impact I want to have on the world, I am more interested in developing solutions that will directly face environmental and sustainability challenges. 

 Alghough I have enjoyed all of the research I have done up until this point, I do not want to spend my entire career in computer science developing digital solutions for digital problems. I want to pursue robotics because t

# What I will do after my masters

My completion of the EPFL robotics program through Fulbright will help me to fill a crucial link in the small but growing chain of roboticists working on climate change. I will be excited to partner with robotic companies like ARC and or start my own … 

I need more help on this. I don’t know yet what I want to do after my master’s, but I know I want to work with startups tackling environmental challenges.
