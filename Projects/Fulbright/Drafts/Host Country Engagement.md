There are four significant avenues for community engagement outside of my master's program that excite me about Switzerland. Primarily, I want to be able to understand and appreciate Swiss culture to the fullest. Although the Robotics program at EPFL has no language requirement, I will hone my French both this year and while completing my master's, with the goal of conversational fluency. I took two semesters of French in college, and I look forward to having many people to practice with. In addition to learning the language, I plan to engage with the climbing community. Part of my motivation to pursue climate robotics comes from interests me as a destination, is its magnificent peaks, and the culture that surrounds them. A love for the outdoors inspires me to pursue climate robotics. Finally, Switzerland is home to conventions related to robotics and climate change, including the Smart Energy Event Hosted by The Ark Foundation and CleantechAlps, and Swiss Robotics Day, hosted by Beaulieu SA.
