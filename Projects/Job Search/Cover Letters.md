Dear NAME Manager,

I am a senior at Haverford College with a passion for Computer Science and Visual Studies. I was drawn to your NAME, EXPLANATION

Hello! My name is Macintyre Sunde and I am excited to have found your software engineering position on the New York Times job board. I am a recent graduate of Haverford College and Computer Science major. I am applying because I have experience in many of the responsibilities required of this position.

***Research with Professor Kumar***

The experience that has best prepared me for this position is my research with professor Kumar doing biometric security research. The internship took place over the summers of 2019 and 2020. The research involved using data of user mouse movements to develop methods to authenticate or identify users. 

I also have experience with machine learning using python and Tensorflow. I completed a two-summer long internship with visiting Professor Kumar where we compared multiple machine learning techniques for authentication and identification using mouse biometric data. The end goal was to investigate the viability of various models for industry use in high security environments such as bank accounts or medical portals. I also gained valuable experience working remotely with a team across many time zones.

***Noise Tools***

My summer 2022 work included an independent project on texture/mesh generation. After being inspired by Sebastian Lague on YouTube, I created a Unity package called “noise tools”, for visualizing different smooth noise functions as textures and geometry. I’ve now taken the idea in a different direction by publishing an open-source Unity package and building a UI for easy addition, subtraction and multiplication of different noise functions. I also gained experience working with HLSL for generating meshes on the GPU, to generate large meshes in real time.

***Thesis***

My thesis work has allowed me the chance to work on a larger, long-term project. During the Spring and Fall of 2022 I assisted Professor Aline Normoyle from Bryn Mawr College on a collaborative project called SPACES (Spatialized Performance And Ceremonial Event Simulations). SPACES’ goal is to create parameterized simulations for understanding how celebrations and other large events looked in the pre-Columbian city of Pachacamac. My thesis focused on developing a tool to visualize architecture by designing text encodings for geometry that can be unpacked into complex models. The encoding is known as a Shape Grammar, and works well with self similar or repetitive models. Shape Grammars allow for small changes to an aspect of geometry to be propagated throughout a larger model without having to rework it entirely.

I work with Unity Engine frequently. My most recent project was designing a system for creating procedural architecture using shape grammars. I did this work as part of my thesis and on behalf of my advisor, Professor Aline Normoyle who will use the work in her SPACES project (Spatialized Performance And Ceremonial Event Simulations).

***Incomplete Cube***

Lastly, I have a passion for unconventional digital art. As my final for a class on conceptual art taught by Haverford professor John Muse, I recreated Sol Lewitt’s *Incomplete Cube* as a digital installation. *Incomplete Cube* was originally exhibited at the John Webber Gallery in New York City in 1974. I translated the digital experience online into a first person experience and played with the scale of the cubes, putting the observer in the exhibit rather than outside it looking in. The piece was designed in Blender and Unity, and submitted to Haverford’s 2020 Film Festival as part of their ‘New Media’ showcase. Find it online [here](https://cosmicpotato.itch.io/incomplete-cube).

is a documentation and exhibition of all connected permutations of side lengths of a cube that imply its three dimensions. *Variations on Incomplete Open Cubes*

********************************OpenGL Class********************************

My experience that has best prepared me for this position is a computer graphics class that I took with professor Aline Normoyle at Bryn Mawr College in the fall of 2021. The class covered a fair amount of the OpenGL library as well as writing vertex, fragment, and compute shaders in GLSL. The projects for the class ranged from 2D image processing to ray tracing.

***Trading Bots***

I have experience writing trading bots in both Meta Quotes Language and python. As an independent project last summer I spent a few weeks learning and implementing different strategies for predicting the market at different time scales. I plan to continue this project in the future, implementing strategies that my brother, who is learning day trading, comes up with.

I would welcome the chance to further explore how my experiences, skills and passion might be a good fit for this position. Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself and I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,

Macintyre Sunde
