## Education

**HaverfordCollege:** B.A. in Computer Science Graduated: Spring, 2023
GPA: 3.44/3.52 in major
Relevant coursework: Analysis of Algorithms, Computer Graphics, Linear Algebra, Computer Architecture

## Work Experience

**TeachingA ssistant CS251 (C/C++):** Haverford College - Fall 2022
- Assisted students with labs and homework on the topics of computer architecture; programming
- languages and idioms; Haverford Educational RISC Architecture (HERA).
- Collaborated with professors Dougherty and Wonnacott to optimize the learning experience both in the classroom and during TA office hours.
- **Machine Learning Intern (Python):** Haverford College-Rajesh Kumar - Summers 2020 and 2022
- Goal: Develop a technique for continuous authentication for use in high security applications.
- Implemented and compared 1D and 2D CNNs with traditional neural networks with the task of differentiating between users’ biometric mousesignatures.
- Results: The 2D CNN outperformed
- our other methods.

## Additional Experience

**Archaeological Reconstruction Using Shape Grammars (C#/Unity):** Spring and Fall 2022
- Project advisedby Professor Aline Normoyle
- Researched shapegrammars as a tool to procedurally generate structures and cities.
- Implemented a version of L-Systems to generate raster images of fractals and trees. Designed a grammar in Unity Engine to visualize the pre-Columbian city of Pachacamac (Peru)
- Designed my own interpreted scripting language and used it to manipulate models in Unity.

**Noise Tools (C#/Unity):** Personal project inspired by Sebastian Lague - Summer 2022
- Created a Unity package for procedural texture and volume manipulation.
- Used compute shaders to experiment with different types of noise in 2 and 3D, including simplex and perlin noise generated with hashtables and pseudorandom functions.
- Designed a modular UI to manipulate and add different noise types in realtime.
- Implemented the marching cube algorithm to make meshes out of textures.

**Compilers(C++/Bison/Flex):** Course taught by Professor David Wonnacott - Spring 2022
- Built a working non-optimizing compiler in C++ for Andrew Appel's Tiger language
- Used Appel’s “Modern Compiler Implementation in C” as reference and Bison/Flex for the grammar and parser.
- **Computer Graphics (C++/OpenGL/GLSL):** Course taught by Professor Aline Normoyle - Spring 2021
- Learned the basics of using 2D/3D graphics using OpenGL and GLSL. 
- Completed homework projects ranging from raster image processing to raytracing. 
- Studied and implemented boids as a final project.
